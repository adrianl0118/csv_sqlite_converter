# About

A handy little Python script for translating data between CSV and SQLite3 format in either direction.

# Disclaimer

This script has as of yet not been utilized in a merge/join situation (two partial and possibly overlapping sets of data being united into one set with no duplicate entries)--use at your own risk.
